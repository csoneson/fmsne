\title{Create diagnostic plot of Hausdorff distances}
\usage{
hausdorffDistPlot(
  mat,
  Nvec,
  Nrep = 5,
  q = 1e-04,
  seed = NULL,
  methods = c("geosketch", "scsampler", "uniform"),
  extraArgs = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{m x n matrix. Samples (the dimension along which to subsample)
should be in the rows, features in the columns.}

\item{Nvec}{Numeric vector of sketch sizes.}

\item{Nrep}{Numeric scalar indicating the number of sketches to draw
for each sketch size.}

\item{q}{Numeric scalar in [0,1], indicating the fraction of largest
minimum distances to discard when calculating the robust Hausdorff
distance. Setting q=0 gives the classical Hausdorff distance.
The default is 1e-4, as suggested by Hie et al (2019).}

\item{seed}{Numeric scalar or \code{NULL} for initialization of the
random number generator.}

\item{methods}{Character vector, indicating which method(s) to include
in the plot. Should be a subset of c("geosketch", "scsampler",
"uniform"), where "uniform" randomly samples from input features
with uniform probabilities.}

\item{extraArgs}{Named list providing extra arguments to the respective
methods (beyond the matrix and the sketch size). The names of the list
should be the method names (currently, "geosketch" or "scsampler"),
and each list element should be a named list of argument values. See
the examples for an illustration of how to use this argument. Note that
the \code{seed} argument, if provided to any of the methods,
will be ignored in favor of the global \code{seed} argument
(since the former would imply providing the same seed for each
repeated run of the sketching).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Create diagnostic plot showing the Hausdorff distance between a sketch
and the full data set, for varying sketch sizes.
}
\examples{
## Generate example data matrix
mat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100)

## Generate diagnostic Hausdorff distance plot
## (including all available methods)
hdp <- hausdorffDistPlot(mat, Nvec = c(10, 25, 50))

## Provide additional arguments for geosketch
hdp <- hausdorffDistPlot(mat, Nvec = c(10, 25, 50), Nrep = 2,
                         extraArgs = list(geosketch = list(max_iter = 100)))
