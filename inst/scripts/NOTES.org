- How to compare, when t-SNE is run on the PCA data (I believe run on
  most variable genes, 50 PCs) and MS versions on top features. Should
  we try to run all of it on PCAs and/or top features?

- `calculateTSNE()` uses the PCA step in `Rtsne::Rtsne()`, which uses,
  by default 50 PCs.

- `calculateTSNE()` also uses the `ntop` (500 by default) feautres
  with the largest variances (unless set manually with `subset_row`).

- Also, the DR method can be applied on existing dimensionality
  reduction results in 'x' by setting the 'dimred' argument.

- To use all features, pass `rep(TRUE, nrow(object))`.

- Use non-fast methods, shouldn't be a problem time-wise for 1300 genes.

- (FMSTSNE: could try bht 0.75)

Plan
- compare from same PCA
- compare from same 500 topn (but t-SNE also funs PCA)
- compare from same 500 topn, disabling PCA prior to t-SNE
- compare on all features (or set topn to large number)
