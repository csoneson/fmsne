- Licensing?

- How to compare, when t-SNE is run on the PCA data (I believe run on
  most variable genes, 50 PCs) and MS versions on top features. Should
  we try to run all of it on PCAs and/or top features?

- Use non-fast methods, shouldn't be a problem time-wise for 1300 genes.

- QA should be run on top genes only - same ones as those fed methods.

- (FMSTSNE: could try bht 0.75)
